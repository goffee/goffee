// RealIP is a middleware that sets a http.Request's RemoteAddr to the results
// of parsing either the X-Forwarded-For header or the X-Real-IP header (in that
// order).
//
// This middleware should be inserted fairly early in the middleware stack to
// ensure that subsequent layers (e.g., request loggers) which examine the
// RemoteAddr will see the intended value.
//
// You should only use this middleware if you can trust the headers passed to
// you (in particular, the two headers this middleware uses), for example
// because you have placed a reverse proxy like HAProxy or nginx in front of
// Goji. If your reverse proxies are configured to pass along arbitrary header
// values from the client, or if you use this middleware without a reverse
// proxy, malicious clients will be able to make you very sad (or, depending on
// how you're using RemoteAddr, vulnerable to an attack of some sort).
